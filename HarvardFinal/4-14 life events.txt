@r 2 You approach the old man sitting on the upside-down trash can and he suddenly starts screaming random garbled noises at you. Suddenly a light appears around you that blinds you. As you regain your senses you feel nauseous and weirded out but for some reason smarter?? The old man disappeared and you continued on with your day a bit creeped out.
@s7 Your parents want to take you to tutoring after school to help up your grades a bit. What will you do?
